# Network Implementation Todo List

1. Implement proper error handling for network operations
   - Add try-catch blocks around network code (partially done in I_InitNetwork)
   - Create specific error types for network-related issues
   - Add error handling to Net_InitNetwork function

2. Improve network message serialization and deserialization
   - Implement a more robust serialization system for game state
   - Add versioning to network messages for future compatibility

3. Implement network game synchronization
   - Develop a system to handle network latency and packet loss
   - Implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation

4. Add support for multiple game rooms/lobbies
   - Create a lobby system for players to join before starting a game
   - Implement room creation and management

5. Enhance security measures
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data
   - Add authentication system for players

6. Optimize network performance
   - Implement delta compression for game state updates
   - Add bandwidth throttling and prioritization of network messages

7. Improve player connection/disconnection handling
   - Implement graceful disconnection handling
   - Add reconnection functionality for temporarily disconnected players

8. Create a more robust matchmaking system
   - Implement skill-based matchmaking
   - Add support for custom game settings

9. Implement voice chat functionality
   - Add voice chat support for in-game communication
   - Implement push-to-talk and always-on voice options

10. Add network diagnostics and debugging tools
    - Create a network statistics display for players
    - Implement logging for network-related events and errors

11. Enhance the user interface for multiplayer features
    - Create intuitive menus for joining and hosting games
    - Add visual feedback for network status and quality

12. Implement anti-cheat measures
    - Develop server-side validation for player actions
    - Implement a reporting system for suspicious behavior

13. Add support for dedicated servers
    - Create a separate dedicated server application
    - Implement server browser functionality

14. Optimize client-server communication
    - Implement more efficient protocols for frequent updates (e.g., player positions)
    - Add support for UDP hole punching for peer-to-peer connections

15. Implement cross-platform multiplayer
    - Ensure network code is compatible across different platforms
    - Add platform-specific optimizations where necessary
